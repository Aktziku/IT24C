                        As a beginner in web development, diving into the world of CSS and HTML can be quite overwhelming. 
                        The endless lines of code and the intricacies of web design seem like a daunting challenge. However, with determination and consistent effort, I believe that I can conquer this learning curve and become proficient in creating websites. 
                        With the code provided by our instructor, I can easily put words or paragraphs on HTML files and add images to the background.
                        Designing the web is more challenging because it is hard to align the words and the combination of colors that can be suited to the background and choosing the family font and the text size that is not hard to read is a little bit challenging. 
                        Even with that, I experimented with the code that had been provided like changing some elements and how they interact with each other like aligning the text and linking the files. 
                        With this activity, I want to explore more about web development by starting by learning the basics like color combinations, especially when choosing fonts, background colors that make the web more appealing, and the common elements that are being used in web development. 
                        I know that web development is a field that frequently evolves, but many resources can help me to improve my learnings and skills of course also with the guidance of our instructors of this subject.
